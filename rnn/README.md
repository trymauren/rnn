# This folder contains the RNN classes

- rnn.py holds the model built from scratch by the group
- pytorch_rnn_sine.py holds the pytorch model built for sine experiment comparison.
- pytorch_rnn_emb.py holds the pytorch model built for NLP experiment comparison. The code was written in a hurry with little pytorch knowledge and is prone to bugs.
